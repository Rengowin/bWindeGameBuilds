This repository contains the **playable build** of my solo Unity prototype, developed as part of my *Game Engine* course at HTW Berlin.  
*(Version from 15.11.2025)*

The prototype is inspired by the looping gameplay concept from **Loop Hero**, but without roguelike mechanics or card systems. Instead, the game uses a simple upgrade-point system to increase player stats over time.

**Note:**  
The player keeps moving while the upgrade menu is open, so I recommend pausing before selecting upgrades. This behavior is intentional for low movement speeds but becomes challenging if you stack speed upgrades.

There are still a few known issues (for example, the game remains paused after death until the player manually pauses/unpauses again).

The temporary music is from the *Subnautica* soundtrack and was added for academic assignment purposes.

## About the Project

This prototype focuses on implementing a straightforward **high-score based gameplay loop**, including:

- Endless looping arena  
- Basic upgrade system  
- Score increasing through defeating enemies  
- Independent implementations of key systems (player logic, enemy spawns, game loop, scoring)  
- Built entirely using **Unity** and **C#**  

### Project Goals

- Practice core gameplay programming  
- Develop and refine gameplay loops  
- Independently implement, debug, and structure gameplay systems  
- Improve ability to plan and execute a small solo project

## Controls

- **Left Mouse Button** – with the UI interaction (upgrade menu, pause and main menu) 
- **Upgrades** – Accessible through the menu (pause recommended)
